This project was created for the Digital School Hackathon and uses XAMPP as the local server environment.

To run the project:
1. Place the entire project folder inside the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
2. Import the `hackathon_db.sql` file into your local MySQL database using phpMyAdmin or a similar tool to create the necessary database and tables.
3. Make sure to update the `db.php` file if needed to match your local database credentials.

After this, you should be able to run the project locally by navigating to `http://localhost/your-project-folder` in your browser.
